# PRD: MVRA - Minimal Viable Reasoning Agent (AZR-like System)

Okay, I can break down the comprehensive report into a series of digestible chunks and prompts. This should provide a clearer, step-by-step guide for a developer looking to implement the Minimal Viable Reasoning Agent (MVRA) with an Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR)-like architecture using DSPy and Unsloth.
Here are the prompts and digestible chunks:
Developer's Guide to Building an MVRA/AZR-like System
This guide breaks down the architecture and implementation steps for creating a self-improving reasoning agent.
1. Core Concept & Goal
 * High-Level Goal: Develop a Minimal Viable Reasoning Agent (MVRA) that learns and improves its reasoning capabilities autonomously, similar to an Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR).
 * Core Technologies:
   * DSPy: For structuring the agent's reasoning pipeline, defining modules, and optimizing prompts/module interactions. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]
   * Unsloth: For efficient fine-tuning of the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) using self-generated data. [34, 35, 36, 10, 37, 38, 39, 40, 23, 41]
 * Fundamental Principle: The agent operates on a self-improvement loop, generating its own tasks and solutions, which are then verified by an Automated Verifier. This feedback loop drives learning without human-labeled examples. [42, 43, 44, 45]
2. Structuring the Agent with DSPy
 * Modular Design:
   * Define the core components of your MVRA, primarily the "Task Proposer" and "Solver," as dspy.Module instances. [1, 2, 6, 16, 22, 29, 31]
   * Each module will encapsulate a specific part of the reasoning process.
 * Signatures for Clarity and Optimization:
   * For each dspy.Module, define a dspy.Signature. This specifies the expected inputs and outputs, along with natural language descriptions (desc) for each field. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 16, 22, 27, 29, 31]
   * Crucial: The desc fields are actively used by DSPy optimizers (like MIPRO) to generate and refine effective prompts. Make these descriptions clear and precise. [8, 9, 16, 22]
 * DSPy Module Implementation (Conceptual Example):
   import dspy

# --- Define Signatures ---
class ProposeTaskSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Proposes a new task based on current knowledge, aiming for tasks that are novel and appropriately difficult."""
    current_knowledge = dspy.InputField(desc="Summary of what the agent has learned so far or current state.")
    # Consider adding: previous_tasks_summary = dspy.InputField(desc="Summary of recently attempted tasks to encourage novelty.")
    new_task_description = dspy.OutputField(desc="A clear, actionable description of the new task.")
    # Optional: estimated_difficulty_category = dspy.OutputField(desc="Categorical estimate of task difficulty (e.g., easy, medium, hard).")

class SolveTaskSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Attempts to solve the given task, providing a solution and detailed reasoning steps."""
    task_description = dspy.InputField(desc="The task to be solved.")
    # Consider adding: available_tools_list = dspy.InputField(desc="List of tools the solver can use.", pydantic_type=list[str], required=False)
    proposed_solution = dspy.OutputField(desc="The final solution to the task.")
    reasoning_trace = dspy.OutputField(desc="A detailed, step-by-step explanation of the thought process used to arrive at the solution.")

# --- Define Modules ---
class TaskProposer(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Start with dspy.Predict; can evolve to more complex modules (e.g., using ReAct or custom logic)
        self.propose = dspy.Predict(ProposeTaskSignature) 

    def forward(self, current_knowledge, previous_tasks_summary=None):
        # Example of how to potentially encourage novelty
        if previous_tasks_summary:
            return self.propose(current_knowledge=current_knowledge, previous_tasks_summary=previous_tasks_summary)
        return self.propose(current_knowledge=current_knowledge)

class Solver(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # dspy.ChainOfThought is good for tasks needing explicit reasoning.
        # For code generation, dspy.ProgramOfThought might be more suitable.
        # For tasks requiring external tools, dspy.ReAct is an option.
        self.solve = dspy.ChainOfThought(SolveTaskSignature) 

    def forward(self, task_description, available_tools_list=None):
        if available_tools_list:
            return self.solve(task_description=task_description, available_tools_list=available_tools_list)
        return self.solve(task_description=task_description)

# --- Define the Main Agent Pipeline ---
class MVRAPipeline(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.task_proposer = TaskProposer()
        self.solver = Solver()

    def forward(self, current_knowledge, previous_tasks_summary=None, available_tools_list=None):
        proposed_task_details = self.task_proposer(current_knowledge=current_knowledge, previous_tasks_summary=previous_tasks_summary)
        solution_attempt = self.solver(task_description=proposed_task_details.new_task_description, available_tools_list=available_tools_list)

        # This output is then passed to the Automated Verifier
        return dspy.Prediction(
            task_description=proposed_task_details.new_task_description, 
            proposed_solution=solution_attempt.proposed_solution,
            reasoning_trace=solution_attempt.reasoning_trace
            # estimated_difficulty_category=proposed_task_details.estimated_difficulty_category (if signature includes it)
        )

# --- Configure DSPy with your LLM ---
# Example:
# turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', max_tokens=250)
# dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)

   * Note on Module Choices:
     * dspy.Predict: Basic input-to-output. [1, 2, 6, 16, 22, 29, 31]
     * dspy.ChainOfThought: For step-by-step reasoning. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 46, 14, 16, 18, 22, 27, 29, 31]
     * dspy.ProgramOfThought: For generating and executing code as part of the solution. [1, 2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 29, 31]
     * dspy.ReAct: For agentic behavior involving tool use. [1, 2, 6, 47, 16, 18, 22, 25, 29, 31, 48]
3. LLM Specialization with Unsloth
 * Goal: Fine-tune your base LLM (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral) to become more proficient at the specific types of tasks generated and solved by your MVRA. [34, 35, 36, 10, 37, 38, 40, 41]
 * Data for Fine-Tuning: Use the (task_description, verified_solution) pairs generated by the self-play loop and confirmed by your Automated Verifier.
 * Unsloth Benefits:
   * Faster training and reduced memory usage (often via optimized LoRA and 4-bit quantization). [34, 49, 10, 37, 41]
   * Supports training on "completions/responses only," which fits the (task, solution) data. [37]
   * Compatible with custom datasets. [34, 35, 37, 38, 22]
 * Data Formatting for Unsloth:
   * Structure your data typically as instruction/prompt and output/completion pairs.
     * Example: {"instruction": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11", "output": "x = 3"}
   * Alternatively, use a chat-based format if your base LLM is instruction-tuned for chat. [38]
     * Example: {"messages":}
   * Utilize Unsloth's formatting_prompts_func and get_chat_template for applying appropriate templates. [38]
   * If your dataset uses ShareGPT format ("from"/"value"), use standardize_sharegpt to convert it. [38]
 * Key Consideration: The diversity and quality of tasks generated by the Task Proposer are critical. Fine-tuning will specialize the LLM for the types of tasks it sees. A narrow curriculum will lead to narrow specialization. [50, 51, 52, 53, 54]
4. The DSPy-Unsloth Iterative Loop
 * Synergistic Cycle:
   * DSPy Orchestration: Use DSPy with the current LLM (initially a base model, later a fine-tuned one) to run the Proposer-Solver pipeline.
   * Data Generation: The Proposer generates a task, the Solver attempts it.
   * Verification: Your Automated Verifier checks the Solver's solution.
   * Data Collection: Store (task_description, verified_solution, verifier_outcome) as dspy.Example objects.
   * Unsloth Fine-Tuning: Periodically, use the accumulated verified (task_description, verified_solution) pairs to fine-tune the LLM with Unsloth. This creates a new, specialized version of your LLM. [10, 37]
   * DSPy Re-Optimization: After fine-tuning, the LLM's characteristics will have changed. Crucially, re-run DSPy optimizers (e.g., BootstrapFewShot, MIPRO) using your self-generated dspy.Example data. This adapts the prompts and few-shot examples specifically for the newly fine-tuned LLM. [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22]
   * Repeat: Continue the cycle with the updated DSPy programs and the further fine-tuned LLM.
 * Frequency: Fine-tuning (Unsloth) is generally more resource-intensive. Consider doing it after accumulating a significant batch of new, high-quality data. DSPy prompt optimization can be done more frequently.
5. Designing the Automated Verifier
 * Role: The Automated Verifier is the cornerstone of learning without human labels. It provides the "ground truth" for the system. [42, 43, 55, 56, 57, 47, 58, 53, 59, 60]
 * Implementation: Implement as external Python code (not reliant on another LLM if aiming for strict AZR principles).
 * Characteristics:
   * Reliability & Determinism: Must be highly accurate. Errors here directly create flawed training data. [56, 57, 58, 53]
   * Scope: Defines what the agent can learn. A verifier for code execution enables learning coding tasks; a math checker enables learning math. [42, 43, 56]
   * Efficiency: Called frequently, so it should be computationally lean.
 * Suitable Domains for Verifiers:
   * Mathematics (e.g., using symbolic math libraries).
   * Code Generation (e.g., using unit tests, code executors). [42, 43, 56]
   * Logical Puzzles with formal rules.
 * Challenges:
   * Open-ended tasks: Difficult to verify (e.g., creative writing, commonsense reasoning). [55, 57, 47, 58, 53]
   * Verifier Oracle Problem: Avoid using an LLM as the primary verifier if it introduces biases or relies on human-labeled data from its own training.
   * Goodhart's Law / Verifier Hacking: The agent might find trivial ways to satisfy the verifier without genuine understanding. The verifier needs to be robust against this. [56]
   * Maintenance: As the agent tackles more complex tasks, the verifier might need updates.
6. Crafting Verifier-Driven Metrics for DSPy Optimizers
 * Purpose: To provide a quantitative score to DSPy optimizers, guiding them to improve module prompts and few-shot examples.
 * Input Data for Optimizers: Use the self-generated (task_description, verified_solution) pairs, where the solution is confirmed correct by your Automated Verifier. Structure these as dspy.Example objects.
   * Example structure: dspy.Example(task_description="Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 11", actual_solver_output="x = 3", verifier_assessment_is_correct=True).with_inputs("task_description")
 * Metric Function Implementation:
   * Create a Python function that takes example: dspy.Example, prediction: dspy.Prediction, and an optional trace=None.
   * Inside the function, call your external my_automated_verifier(task_description, solution_attempt) using example.task_description and prediction.proposed_solution (or the relevant output field from your Solver's signature).
   * Return a score (e.g., 1.0 for correct, 0.0 for incorrect).
   * If trace is not None (used by optimizers like BootstrapFewShot during demonstration generation), the metric should typically return a boolean (True if the prediction is good enough to be a demo, False otherwise). [12, 13, 16, 22, 61]
   import dspy

# Assume my_automated_verifier(task_description: str, solution_attempt: str) -> bool is defined elsewhere.

# Example Solver Signature (ensure field names match your actual Solver's output)
class SolveTaskSignature(dspy.Signature):
    task_description = dspy.InputField()
    proposed_solution = dspy.OutputField() 
    # Add other output fields like reasoning_trace if your Solver produces them

def verifier_metric(example: dspy.Example, prediction: dspy.Prediction, trace=None) -> float:
    """
    Custom DSPy metric using an external verifier.
    'example' holds the input fields (e.g., example.task_description).
    'prediction' holds the output fields from the module being optimized (e.g., prediction.proposed_solution).
    """
    task_desc = example.task_description

    # Ensure 'proposed_solution' matches the actual output field name in your Solver's signature
    solution_attempt = prediction.proposed_solution 

    is_correct_by_verifier = my_automated_verifier(
        task_description=task_desc, 
        solution_attempt=solution_attempt
    )

    if trace is not None:
        # For bootstrapping demonstrations (e.g., with BootstrapFewShot)
        return is_correct_by_verifier 
    else:
        # For scoring during optimization/evaluation
        return 1.0 if is_correct_by_verifier else 0.0

 * Suitable DSPy Optimizers (Teleprompters): [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 62, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 61]
   * BootstrapFewShot: Generates few-shot examples using a teacher model (can be the student module itself) and filters them using your verifier_metric. [4, 8, 12, 13, 62, 16, 20, 22, 63, 61]
     * The metric_threshold parameter can be used if your metric returns a float during bootstrapping. [13, 16, 22]
   * MIPRO (or MIPROv2): Optimizes both instructions and few-shot demonstrations. Uses the float score from verifier_metric. [5, 8, 9, 12, 62, 16, 20, 22, 26, 64]
   * COPRO: Focuses on refining instructions. [8, 16, 22]
7. Advanced Task Generation: The Intelligent Task Proposer
 * Problem: A simple Task Proposer will lead to repetitive or uninformative tasks, hindering learning.
 * Goal: The Task Proposer must generate a curriculum of tasks that are:
   * Appropriately Difficult: Challenging but achievable (Zone of Proximal Development). [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]
   * Novel: To encourage exploration and prevent redundant learning. [65, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 50, 51, 46, 88, 89, 45, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]
   * Diverse: To ensure development of generalizable skills. [44, 47, 65, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 50, 51, 88, 52, 89, 45, 53, 54, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
 * Strategies for Intelligent Task Generation:
   * Difficulty Control:
     * Heuristics: Number of steps, input complexity.
     * Solver's historical success rate on similar tasks. [65, 66, 71]
     * Adaptive difficulty adjustment based on recent Solver performance (e.g., AdaRFT concept: adjust target difficulty based on reward signals). [71, 72, 79]
   * Novelty & Diversity Metrics (Programmatic):
     * Semantic Similarity: Use text embeddings (e.g., from sentence-transformers) and cosine similarity to compare a proposed task with a history of previous tasks. Low similarity can indicate high novelty. [84, 85, 87, 88, 89, 45, 90, 93, 94, 96, 97]
       # Conceptual: Requires sentence-transformers library
# from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
# model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') 
# embedding_new_task = model.encode(new_task_description, convert_to_tensor=True)
# for old_task_embedding in historical_task_embeddings:
#     cosine_scores = util.pytorch_cos_sim(embedding_new_task, old_task_embedding)
#     novelty_score = 1 - cosine_scores.item() # Higher if less similar

     * Task2Vec Diversity Coefficient: Formal measure of intrinsic variability in data batches. [86]
     * NoveltyBench: Benchmark for evaluating distinct and high-quality outputs. [87]
   * Generation Techniques for Diversity:
     * Prompt the Task Proposer to create variations, combine concepts, or explore edge cases.
     * Consider multi-agent approaches for task generation/diversification (e.g., Star-Agents framework for rewriting/diversifying data). [50, 51, 53]
   * Curriculum Sequencing:
     * Progress from simpler to more complex tasks.
     * Frameworks like CurricuLLM (autonomous subtask generation) or AUTO-CEI (using reasoning steps as difficulty proxy) offer inspiration. [68, 69, 70, 73, 74, 75, 81]
 * LaMDAgent Inspiration for Task Proposer: [101, 102, 103, 79]
   * View Task Proposer as an agent whose "action" is task generation.
   * Its "reward" should be tied to the learning utility of the proposed tasks for the Solver.
   * It could maintain a "memory" of past tasks and Solver performance to inform future generation.
8. Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Task Proposer Policy Optimization
 * Concept: Use RL to train the Task Proposer module to generate better tasks. DSPy has experimental RL optimizers (e.g., based on GRPO). [49, 46, 62, 104, 105, 75, 76, 77, 106, 107, 108, 109, 39, 110, 111, 28, 32, 63, 64, 82, 112, 113]
 * Reward Function Design for Task Proposer (Multi-faceted):
   * Solver Performance: Reward based on Solver's success (from Automated Verifier) on the proposed task. [46, 62]
   * Task Novelty: Reward for tasks semantically distinct from previous ones (use embedding similarity as described in section 7). [83, 84, 85, 46, 62, 90, 92, 94]
   * Task Difficulty (Zone of Proximal Development): Reward tasks that are neither too easy nor too hard for the current Solver. [68, 69, 70, 73, 74, 105, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82]
     * Estimate difficulty via: Solver's historical success rate, task description complexity, length of Solver's reasoning trace. [65, 66, 71]
     * Adapt GRPO-LEAD Concepts: [75, 76, 77, 79, 82]
       * Difficulty-Aware Advantage Reweighting:
         * In GRPO, advantage is often calculated by comparing the reward of a sampled action/trajectory against a baseline (e.g., average reward of a group of samples). [106, 107]
         * For the Task Proposer:
           * Solver attempts a task from Proposer; its performance yields a reward (e.g., from verifier_metric).
           * Calculate an "advantage" for the Solver's attempt on that specific task.
           * Reweight this Solver advantage based on the task's assessed difficulty (e.g., tasks in the "sweet spot" get higher weight).
           * The Task Proposer receives a reward that is a function of this reweighted Solver advantage.
   * Solver Learning Progress: (Harder to measure) Reward based on actual improvement in Solver's general capabilities after training on Proposer's tasks.
   * Task Diversity: Incorporate metrics that quantify the diversity of a batch of generated tasks. [44, 47, 65, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 50, 51, 88, 52, 89, 45, 53, 54, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
 * PAPILLON RL Tutorial Insights for Proposer-Solver: The PAPILLON tutorial in DSPy demonstrates optimizing a multi-module program where one module's output (e.g., a redacted query) affects another's performance and incurs a cost (PII leakage). This is analogous to a Proposer (generates task, potentially with "costs" like being too easy/hard) and a Solver (performance depends on the task). [46, 62]
   * Define metrics for proposal "cost" (e.g., inverse of novelty, penalty for being too easy/hard) and solution "quality" (Solver's success).
   * Create judge modules (dspy.Signature, dspy.Module) for these.
   * Develop a composite reward function (e.g., (Solver_Quality_Score - Proposal_Cost_Score)).
   * Use this composite reward with an RL optimizer like dspy.GRPO to train the Proposer.
9. Practical Implementation Hurdles & Mitigations
 * Computational Costs: [44, 55, 3, 8, 57, 104, 52, 114, 115, 58, 15, 110, 19, 21, 116, 117, 118, 119]
   * Challenge: Many LLM calls (Proposer, Solver), RL sample inefficiency, iterative fine-tuning.
   * Mitigations: Efficient base LLMs, quantization (Unsloth), batching for fine-tuning, strategic optimization schedules, lean verifier.
 * Stability of Advanced Optimizers (RL): [49, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 39, 110, 111, 64, 113]
   * Challenge: Sensitivity to hyperparameters, reward function design; achieving stable convergence.
   * Mitigations: Careful reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, start with simpler DSPy optimizers then add RL, continuous monitoring.
 * Ensuring Robust/Generalizable Reasoning: [44, 55, 57, 47, 52, 58, 53, 59, 60]
   * Challenge: Overfitting to self-generated tasks or verifier quirks; "no human labels" means no external correction for generalization.
   * Mitigations: Strong emphasis on task novelty/diversity in Proposer's reward; (optional) periodic evaluation on hidden, diverse benchmarks.
 * Compounding Design Choices:
   * Challenge: Small flaws in any component (verifier, proposer reward) can amplify over iterations.
   * Mitigations: Robust design, meticulous implementation, comprehensive logging and monitoring of all stages.
