# PRD: MVRA - Minimal Viable Reasoning Agent (AZR-like System)

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** MVRA (Minimal Viable Reasoning Agent)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Product Manager:** Applied AI Research Team  

MVRA is an Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR)-like system that learns and improves without human-labeled examples.
