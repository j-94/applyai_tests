# PRD: Vibe Coder - High-Agency Requirements Synthesizer

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Vibe Coder  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Product Manager:** Applied AI Research Team  

Vibe Coder is an advanced AI assistant designed to transform sprawling, unstructured inputs (links, raw notes, discussions, documentation fragments, user ideas) into coherent, structured, and architecturally-aware software requirements. Acting as a high-agency Senior Software Engineer with architectural thinking capabilities, Vibe Coder proactively distills chaos into actionable insights for robust software development.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Information Chaos:** Development teams receive scattered, unstructured inputs from multiple sources
- **Requirements Ambiguity:** Vague or contradictory requirements lead to failed projects
- **Missing Context:** Requirements often lack architectural considerations and traceability
- **Reactive Approach:** Teams wait for explicit direction instead of proactively identifying gaps
- **Lost Knowledge:** Understanding of "why" behind requirements gets lost over time

### Market Opportunity
- Software projects fail 70% of the time due to poor requirements
- Requirements changes cost 50-100x more in later development phases
- Architectural decisions made without proper analysis lead to technical debt
- Need for AI-assisted software architecture design is growing rapidly

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Transform Chaos to Clarity:** Convert unstructured inputs into structured requirements
2. **Architectural Pre-Cognition:** Identify architectural implications early in the process
3. **Proactive Gap Analysis:** Find missing information and potential risks before development
4. **Living Documentation:** Create evolving, traceable requirements that adapt over time

### Success Metrics
- **Time to Requirements:** Reduce requirements analysis time by 60%
- **Requirements Quality:** 90% reduction in ambiguous requirements
- **Change Management:** 50% fewer requirements changes during development
- **Traceability:** 100% of requirements linked to source materials

## User Personas

### Primary Users

**1. Product Managers**
- Need to synthesize stakeholder inputs into coherent product vision
- Struggle with conflicting requirements from different sources
- Want architectural feasibility assessment early

**2. Software Architects** 
- Need to understand system implications of requirements
